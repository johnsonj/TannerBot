# TannerBot
Your personal assistant to the Johnson Klimczak Wedding. Powered by the [Microsoft Bot Framework](https://dev.botframework.com).

# Intent/Disclaimer
This project is developed in the open to show off the Microsoft Bot Framework, a technology I find very exciting. Although I do work for Microsoft, this is in no way endorsed by the company or part of my day job. This is my first C# and ASP.NET project and it's under a very tight deadline so expect some hacks :)

# Goals
Act as a virtual coordinator for the guests and wedding party. Tanner should help me RSVP, find fun things to do, and help me get around the wedding.
